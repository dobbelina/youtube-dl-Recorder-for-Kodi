Done!

To close the recorder press F4
To update youtube-dl, press Ctrl + F1
or delete the youtube-dl.ini to restart setup and download from there.

If you want to be able to start many concurrent downloads, open the
config.txt file and remove the line "--console-title"
This will also remove the download stats dialog.
